This is a high-performance Node.js backend application designed for a Collections Management Platform, built using Repository-Based Architecture and following SOLID principles for maintainability and scalability.
The system uses MongoDB for data storage, Redis for caching, and JWT-based authentication for secure access control.

The API is designed to handle 10,000+ concurrent connections, process 50,000+ API requests per minute, and maintain an average response time of <200ms.

Tech Stack
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Runtime: Node.js (v18+)
* Framework: Express.js
* Database: MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
* Caching: Redis
* Authentication: JWT (Access & Refresh Tokens)
* Security: Bcrypt password hashing, input validation, CORS configuration
* Documentation: Swagger / OpenAPI
* Testing: Jest / Supertest
* Containerization: Docker

Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The application is built on a Repository-Based Architecture with the following layers:
* Routes Layer – Handles incoming HTTP requests.
* Controller Layer – Manages request/response flow.
* Service Layer – Implements business logic.
* Repository Layer – Handles database operations.
* Models Layer – Defines MongoDB schemas.
* Utilities & Middlewares – Authentication, validation, error handling.
* Config Layer – Environment variables, database, and cache configuration.


Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Authentication & Authorization
* User registration & login with rate limiting

Performance Benchmarks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Response Time: <200ms average
2. Throughput: 1000+ requests/sec
3. Concurrent Users: 10,000+
4. Database Query Time: <50ms average



SOLID Principles in Action
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each module/class has a single responsibility.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Services and repositories can be extended without modifying existing code.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Interfaces allow interchangeable service/repository implementations.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Small, focused interfaces.
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions.


Future Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
* GraphQL support alongside REST
* Event-driven architecture with RabbitMQ/Kafka
* Admin dashboard for analytics
* Data encryption at rest
